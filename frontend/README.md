This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Frontend API client and DB access policy

This project centralizes frontend â†’ backend HTTP calls. Please follow these rules to avoid accidental database access during server-side rendering:

- Use `frontend/lib/api-client.ts` (or `frontend/lib/api.ts`) for all calls to the backend API.
- Do NOT import `@prisma/client` or any database client inside `frontend/`. All database work must run in the backend service only.
- For admin operations that require authenticated server-to-server requests, use an app route under `app/api/*` that forwards the incoming auth header and `X-Clerk-User-Id` to the backend (see `app/api/admin/import-quiz/route.ts` for an example).

If you want this enforced automatically, add an ESLint rule (no-restricted-imports) that forbids `@prisma/client` under `frontend/`.
