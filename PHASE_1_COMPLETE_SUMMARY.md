## 📋 Phase 2: What You Need To Do

### Option A: Quick (20 min)
Just add `<ProtectedRoute>` wrapper to:
1. `app/history/page.tsx`
2. `app/leaderboard/page.tsx`
3. `app/stats/page.tsx`

**Result:** Lock icons appear, auth modal works, 80% protected

### Option B: Complete (45 min)
Everything from A, plus:
1. Update `app/admin/page.tsx` with `<AdminRoute>`
2. Add `useAuthPrompt()` to quiz buttons
3. Add auth checks to other features

**Result:** Production-ready system

### Option C: Advanced (60+ min)
Everything from B, plus:
1. Customize AuthModal styling
2. Add role-based rendering
3. Create custom components
4. Add analytics

**Result:** Enterprise-grade system
