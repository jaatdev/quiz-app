# 🔄 User Sync Issue - Quick Fix Guide

## Problem
Your Clerk user account exists, but it's not synced to the Neon database. This is why:
- You can sign in with Clerk ✅
- But `npx tsx scripts/list-users.ts` shows no users ❌

## Why This Happens
The `/welcome` page should automatically sync your Clerk user to the database when you click "Get Started", but for some reason the sync isn't working.

---

## ✅ Solution: Manual Sync

### Step 1: Get Your Clerk User Information

Visit this page while signed in:
```
http://localhost:3001/user-info
```

This page will show:
- Your Clerk User ID
- Your email
- Your name
- **A ready-to-copy command to sync your user**

### Step 2: Run the Sync Command

The page will show a command like this:
```powershell
npx tsx scripts/manual-sync.ts user_abc123xyz your@email.com "Your Name"
```

1. **Copy the command** from the page
2. **Open PowerShell** in the backend directory
3. **Paste and run** the command

### Step 3: Verify User Was Created

```powershell
npx tsx scripts/list-users.ts
```

You should now see your user!

### Step 4: Make Yourself Admin

```powershell
npx tsx scripts/make-admin.ts your@email.com
```

### Step 5: Access Admin Panel

Go to: `http://localhost:3001/admin`

## Alternative: If You Know Your Clerk ID

If you already know your Clerk User ID (starts with `user_`), you can run:

```powershell
cd backend
npx tsx scripts/manual-sync.ts YOUR_CLERK_ID your@email.com "Your Name"
```

### How to Find Your Clerk ID

1. Open browser console (F12) while signed in
2. Type: `window.Clerk.user.id`
3. Copy the ID (starts with `user_`)

Or just visit `/user-info` page - it's easier!

## 🐛 Why Automatic Sync Might Not Work

Possible reasons:
1. **CORS issue** - Frontend can't reach backend API
2. **Wrong API endpoint** - URL mismatch
3. **Database connection issue** - Neon database not responding
4. **Prisma client issue** - Multiple instances causing conflicts

The manual sync bypasses all these issues and directly writes to the database.

1. Visit: `http://localhost:3001/user-info`
2. Copy the command shown
3. Run in PowerShell (backend directory)
4. Run: `npx tsx scripts/make-admin.ts your@email.com`
5. Access: `http://localhost:3001/admin`
