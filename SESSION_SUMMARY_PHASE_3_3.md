## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow
```
1. User sees "Explore Multilingual Quizzes" banner on home
2. Clicks button → navigates to /quiz/multilingual
3. Selects a quiz and clicks "Take Quiz 🚀"
4. Intro screen shows quiz details
5. User selects language preference
6. Quiz starts with questions in selected language
7. User can click "🌐 Change Language" to switch anytime
8. Answers are preserved across language switches
9. After last question, results screen shows score
10. User sees detailed answer review
11. Can click "Try Again" to restart
```

### Language Switching During Quiz
```
User on Question 3 (answered Q1-Q2)
  ↓
Clicks "🌐 Change Language" button
  ↓
Current language cycles: EN → HI → ES → FR → EN
  ↓
Question 3 reloads in new language
  ↓
Previous answers (Q1-Q2) remain saved
  ↓
User continues from Q3 in new language
```

### Localization Pattern
```
Every text element uses:
  const { language } = useLanguage();
  const text = getLocalizedContent(multilingualData, language);
  
With automatic fallback:
  Selected language → English → First available language
```
